![Cover Image](./path_to_cover_image.jpg)  <!-- Replace with actual path to cover image -->

This repository demonstrates how to implement and backtest a trading strategy using the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**. The RSI is a momentum indicator used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market.

The code calculates RSI values, generates buy/sell signals based on RSI thresholds (30 and 70), and backtests the strategy on historical stock price data. Visualizations of the stock price and RSI, along with portfolio performance, are included.
